# FirstNodejsApiBackend_Book_Store

This project is a **Book Store API** built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**.  
It marks the beginning of my backend development journey, where I’ve applied the concepts I learned in a practical project.

### Key Features
- **JWT Authentication & Authorization**
- **Cloudinary Integration** for book image uploads
- **Postman Testing** for all API endpoints
- **Routing and Middleware** implementation
- **MongoDB CRUD Operations**

### About the Project
This project helped me understand how to build a complete backend system — from user authentication to managing books with image uploads.  
In the future, I plan to integrate API with a **Flutter frontend** to create a complete application.

### Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Authentication:** JWT  
- **Image Storage:** Cloudinary  
- **Testing:** Postman
